Hurray!!!!!!
Finally Compleated the half centuery of the journer of 100DaysOfCode.
This has given me a confidence that I can adapt any habbit if I decide to do so.
this has given me a feeling of doing one task that is gonna take me to a compleation of my 100 days journey.
This is my 50th Day of 100Days of code 
So as I have followed, its time for a short project! so I decided to build a “Hangman” game.
-This is a Python script of the classic game “Hangman”. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes. 
If the player guess a letter which exists in the word, the script writes it in all its correct positions.  
The player has 10 turns to guess the word. You can easily customize the game by changing the variables.
