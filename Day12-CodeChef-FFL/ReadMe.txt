This is my 12th Day of 100Days of code 
Today I Developed:
project is to download the entire Youtube playlist in audio format.

Input:
1)The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
2)The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and S.
3)The second line contains N space-separated integers P1,P2,â€¦,PN.
4)The last line contains N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers is 0 if the i-th player is a defender or 1 if the i-th player is a forward.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if it is possible to build a complete team or "no" otherwise (without quotes).
