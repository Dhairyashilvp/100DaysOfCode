This is my 10th Day of 100Days of code 
Today I studied:
Graphs are used to store data collection of points called vertices (nodes) and edges (edges). Graphs can be called as the most accurate representation of a real-world map. They are used to find the various cost-to-distance between the various data points called as the nodes and hence find the least path. Many applications such as Google Maps, Uber, and many more use Graphs to find the least distance and increase profits in the best ways.

PS: I do not copy paset the programs.
I understand the logic and then type the programs myself.
