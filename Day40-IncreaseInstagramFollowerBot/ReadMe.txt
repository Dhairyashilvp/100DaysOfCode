Today is my 40th Day of 100Days of code 
It's been a great journey so far Every day I solve different problems and upload them here.
On every 10th day i try to solve and write a code that is usefull in real life so, 
today being the 40th day I decided to built a instagram bot 
that will increase my followers gradualy over the period of time.

Run Accordingly:
 ---------------------------------------------------
| to run simply use: python .\increaseFollowers.py  |
