# 100DaysOfCode
Main Commitment
I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.
Start Date
October 1st, 2020. 

Additional Rules
I will tweet and post on Reddit about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
I will update the (Log)[ReadMe.txt] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. (If you've just started learning to code, read FAQ)
