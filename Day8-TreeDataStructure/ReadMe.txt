This is my 8th Day of 100Days of code 
Today I studied:
Trees are non-linear Data Structures which have root and nodes. The root is the node from where the data originates and the nodes are the other data points that are available to us. The node that precedes is the parent and the node after is called the child. There are levels a tree has to show the depth of information. The last nodes are called the leaves.
